# TOSCA Intent Discovery

Infrastructure Intent Discovery via TOSCA-based Reverse Engineering

## Overview

This project implements a multi-phase reverse engineering approach to extract infrastructure intent from file-based IaC configurations and generate semantically consistent TOSCA 2.0 models using incremental processing and RAG-based AI augmentation.
